<p align="center">

> I have developed **"Career Management Extension"**. It is very useful for the **students, employees** as you can access all your **application links, applied links, study material, resume, status of applied links** at one place. Inshort this mini portal for you to track everything at one place.


After adding this extension to the google chrome  all the open tabs will be visible inside the extension with save button. When you are saving the tab,  select a category of the tab.

People can save these tabs inside below categories:
* Application Link
* Career Page
* Job Dashboard
* Study Material
* Resume Link

Adding it to above categories, it will go to to-do list and once task is completed , you can move it to completed task.

<!-- ### [Check Release](https://raj-rathod.github.io/tic-toc-game/) -->

### Screenshots

### Set Status

By visiting the saved links inside different categories you can also update status for your saved link like : 

* Apply
* Applied
* Rejected
* Resume Selected
* Interview Fail
* Interview Pass
* Offer Letter

So you can **easily track all the applications and update there status**, You don't need to worry about the **application links and there status as well as study materials** as you can easily access all of them at one place.

Currently I am at the same phase where I want everything at one place and easily see where I have applied and what was the result for that .

Do add this extension to your chrome browser and try this at least once, feel free to provide **feedback, improvements and new ideas**.
